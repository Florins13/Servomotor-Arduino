ServoMotor-Arduino-PWM-ForLoop
This project is made around a Crane ( 3 servo motors attached to some plastic, imiting a robotic arm), conveyor belt to transport objects from A point to B point and one infrared sensor to detect when object gets to B point. When the sensor detects the object, the conveyor belt stops and the Crane starts its routine, takes the object and places it in a box.
